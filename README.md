# Alt.ruist

## Background

*"As the world in which students live evolves, so too must the education they receive about it. Looking historically, it is clear this has always been the case and we, analysing from inside of the system, believe that it is due time for this evolution to occur again for the Information Era we now find ourselves in.*

*Over the past 40 years, video games have cemented their place in global culture. In one study from Common Sense Media in 2015 it was found that 42% of teenagers ‘enjoy [video games] a “a lot”’, the second highest percentage of all the categories researched. This can be further reflected by the fact that the video games sector now accounts for greater than half of the UK’s entertainment industry.* 

*With this in mind, allow us to introduce Alt.ruist – a video game that is also a teaching tool designed to educate young people about a variety of mental health issues while remaining stimulating, engaging, and enjoyable.* 

*Featuring thoughtfully developed characters, a powerful narrative, and a strong emphasis on education: we believe Alt.ruist is the video game to start building the bridge between young people today and the facts about mental health. At its core, Alt.ruist is a product built for young people, by young people and we think that this crucial understanding is what truly elevates our ability of execution above others."*

\- the introduction to Alt.ruist's TeenTech Innovation Log

Alt.ruist was a conceptual video game designed for TeenTech 2022. It was to be a video game focussing on mental health education through non-intrusive storytelling and genuinely enjoyable gameplay.

This repository contains the (admittedly messy - we were rather rushed) code for a demonstration of Alt.ruist's first level we displayed at the TeenTech finals. It's here as both a record of the idea and also an inspiration piece: we have no desire to continue working on a full version of Alt.ruist, however we would love to see someone develop the real deal one day, it's a cause and a concept we honestly believe in. To know our small demonstration could contribute in some small way to a wider development would be most wonderful.

## Opening the project

Alt.ruist was developed using **Godot Engine** versions **3.4.4** and **3.4.5**, it has been neither tested nor verified on any other version.

Simply import the **project.godot** file and the project should open - spaghetti code and all.
